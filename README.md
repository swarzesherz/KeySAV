KeySAV
======

3DS X/Y SaveFile Box PKX cracking program.

KeySAV is a tool I wrote to decrypt portions of the X/Y SaveData from a Digital Save / PowerSaves rip. 
With this tool you can view IVs/Nature/ESV/TSV of Hatched/Unhatched Pok√©mon that are in your boxes.

SUPPORTS BOTH RETAIL CARTRIDGES AND DIGITAL COPIES

In the public released version, I/O for xorpad streams & blanks are encrypted with a weak xorRNG to prevent people from easily reverse engineering the trick. Left this encryption in with the source; it's unneeded but it keeps compatibility with other people's current files.
